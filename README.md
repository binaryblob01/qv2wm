# qv2wm
QV2WM Window Manager for XFree86 and other X11R6-compatible systems.

This is a fork/continuation of the QVWM window manager available many years ago, and sadly forgotten, until now.

!! This is OBSOLTE SOFTWARE. DO NOT USE on production systems !!


This is the original, untouched QVWM build 30042007 source code, the last known official release, here to preserve history.

The build date for those in the United States would be 04/30/2007.
