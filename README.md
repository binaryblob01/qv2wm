QV2WM Window Manager for XFree86 and other X11R6-compatible systems.

This is a fork/continuation of the QVWM window manager available many years ago, and sadly forgotten, until now.

!! This is OBSOLTE SOFTWARE. DO NOT USE on production systems !!

If you wish to see the original, untouched source code, you can do so via the orig-* branches. These will never be merged into master, DO NOT pull request them.
